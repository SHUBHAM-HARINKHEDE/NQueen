        In this problem, you are given an empty chess board of dimensions N * N.
        \nThe task is to safely place N queens, one in each row such that they cause no harm to each other  .
        \nThe basic idea is mentioned below:
        \nStart from the first row
        \nSelect a column and if it is empty, well within the limits of the board and in no immediate danger, then place the queen in the cell
        \nProceed to the next row
        \nTwo conditions might occur,
        \nall the rows are safely filled
        \nsomewhere down the line, one of the queens cant be placed in a row.
        \nHere we need to backtrack, because a decision was wrongly made in the past

        based on one of the chess rules, demonstrating the behavior
        of the queen in the board, to win you have to find spots to
        move the queen 8 times.The eight queens puzzle is based on
        the classic stategy games problem which is in this case
        putting eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard such that
        none of them is able to capture any other using the standard chess queen.
